#The start of one, anyway

I had some layout issues and at the 11th hour, I submitted a tutor request for some help with my css.

10 minutes into the tutor session, my tutor reveals that html and css, the basis for my project, are his weakest suits.

We trouble-shoot together and spend majority of hour on my header.

Missed the due date, so made some final touches with some help googling some of my issues, but in the end, made it hand-in ready. 

It still needs some work, but by the end of the course, I'm sure it will have evolved into something I can be proud of.
